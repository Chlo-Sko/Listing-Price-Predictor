# Listing Price Predictor
## C964 Computer Science Capstone - Machine Learning Project

<h1> Project Proposal </h1>

## Summary Of The Problem
Comparative Market Analysis is both a time consuming and often inaccurate
process that leads to inconsistent listing prices and underserved clients. To
reduce the time taken to complete these analyses, a consistent pricing model
must be used. While some technologies exist in assisting with these processes,
they are of themselves time consuming, requiring much agent involvement and
produce inconsistent results. Many times this leads to clients not receiving
enough focus and time from their agents and listing prices that are lower than
their potential.

## Benefits Of The Data Product
By providing a simple, swift and consistent price model for all Welcome Home
Realty agents to utilize, the agents will save time, providing higher level service 
to their current clients and allowing them to take on more, resulting in higher
profits for Welcome Home Realty.

##Outline Of Data Product
The listing price calculator allows agents to enter brief information about the
property and outputs an accurate listing price range based on over 800,000 data
entries collected and updated weekly throughout the United States.

##Description Of Data
The implementation of this listing price calculator will require real estate
listing data including the square footage, acreage, as well as bedroom
and bathroom counts of houses currently listed and recently sold in the
United States. The data will be scrubbed for outliers both accurate and
inaccurately caused by agent error. The model will also prioritize the
features which most affect listing price, removing redundant and
unnecessary categories, simplifying the agent’s input & producing a more
accurate prediction.

## Objectives And Hypotheses Of The Project
The implementation of the listing price calculator should result in a decrease of
agent time spent on pricing predictions. It will improve current client
relationships and also encourage new clients with an increase to the client base.
Implementation will produce more confidence in listing price predictions and
lead to an increase in sales and listing prices. Lastly, by pioneering this
technology, the public image of the company will increase due to its proclivity to
innovation. If provided enough clean data samples, this machine learning model
will predict listing prices faster and at a higher accuracy than human real estate
agents.

## Project Methodology
This project will be developed utilizing the SDLC methodology, since the
majority of the work needed for the project is in its initial development and not
in regular maintenance. The requirements of this project are well outlined and
understood and will require minimal adjustments and alterations once
developed. This methodology will provide the most swift and cost effective
solution.
Already understanding the need for the machine learning model, the next step
in the process is to define the requirements of the new system. This step will be
completed by the Welcome Home Realty IT team. The team will then plan the
design, development, execution and implementation of the model. After
planning & designing the software, the data science and software development
team will develop the product. Upon completion of the development step, the
software will be tested both by the development team as well as external and
user testers to ensure the highest quality product. Lastly, the product will be
deployed and presented to the end users. Thereafter, only systematic
maintenance will be completed on the project
